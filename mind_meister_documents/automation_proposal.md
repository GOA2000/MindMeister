# Automation Testing Framework Proposal


## Challenge: Automation Testing Framework Proposal

For the productivity suite like MindMeister, I would recommend leveraging robust automation frameworks such as Selenium Java (Playwright is very simmilar), Jest, and Cypress.
In the following text I will breakdown PROS and CONS for each framework.

### Pretext

For the task at hand, I selected Cypress for a couple of reasons:

- **Fast setup:** I needed to be fast with the task I was given.
- **Implemented promise resolutions:** There is no custom logic for promise resolutions, and a lot of wait mechanisms work out of the box.
- **Simple configuration.**
- **Solid documentation and community.**

While my task was done in Cypress, that does not mean it is the best tool for the job. I believe that the best tool for the job can only be selected after exploring the codebase, structure, developer and UI/UX input, as well as considering our resources and time constraints.


**Selenium with Java or Playwright PROS:**

- **Powerful Combination:** Selenium with Java or Playwright offers robust support for web application testing across various browsers and platforms.

**Jest Cons:**

- **Limited Browser Support:** Jest is primarily designed for testing JavaScript code in Node.js environments, which may limit its compatibility with browser-specific testing scenarios. This means that certain features or behaviors specific to web browsers may not be fully supported or tested with Jest
- **Additional configuration necessary out of the box:** While Jest offers numerous built-in features for testing, it was primarily designed for front-end component and unit testing in JavaScript applications. Therefore, additional configuration and customization may be required to adapt Jest for testing specific backend or full-stack applications. This could involve implementing additional code and configurations to extend Jest's functionality beyond its initial scope.
- **Steep Learning Curve for Complex Configurations:** Setting up Jest for more complex testing scenarios or integrating it with other tools and libraries may pose challenges for beginners or those unfamiliar with JavaScript testing. Configuring Jest for specialized requirements or advanced use cases may require a significant investment of time and effort to understand its intricacies and best practices.
- **Community Support:** While Jest has a growing community and ecosystem of plugins and integrations, it may not offer the same level of extensive support and resources as more established testing frameworks. This could result in fewer community-driven solutions or resources available for addressing specific issues or requirements. On the other hand almost all JS frameworks have dependencies which can be interchangably used which is a good trade off.

**Cypress Pros:**

- **Single Tool for End-to-End Testing:** Cypress is a comprehensive solution for end-to-end testing, eliminating the need for integrating multiple testing tools and simplifying the testing workflow.

**Cypress Cons:**
- **Cypress does not like conditional testing:** Conditional testing is specifically hard on cypress example: if a then b else if c then d
This is non deterministic behaviour and cypress discourages it since tests should be deterministic, real life aplications hence might pose challanges.
- **Slow Test speed:** While Cypress is run in browser, hence faster, the lifecycle of tests might cause tests to be much slower ie. Each 'It' inside of a 'describe' flushes cookies and cash which makes every test robust, but also makes a lot of unnecesary boiler plate- steps to take place, ie For every 'It' we need to do the login sequence, we cannot just reload the main landing page and continue.
- **Limited Browser Support:** Cypress currently supports only Chromium-based browsers, such as Chrome and Electron, limiting its compatibility with other browsers like Firefox and Safari.
- **Backend Testing Limitations:** Cypress is primarily designed for front-end testing and may have limitations when testing backend services or APIs, requiring additional tools or custom solutions for comprehensive testing of full-stack applications.
- **Learning Curve for Complex Scenarios:** While Cypress is easy to get started with for basic testing scenarios, mastering advanced features and handling complex testing scenarios may require additional time and effort due to its unique architecture and approach.
- **Community and Ecosystem:** While Cypress has a growing community and ecosystem of plugins and extensions, it may not offer the same breadth of resources and support as more established testing frameworks like Selenium, potentially limiting extensibility for specialized requirements.
- **Paid Version Benefits:** Certain advanced features and capabilities, such as parallel test execution and access to premium support, are available only in the paid version of Cypress. Investing in the paid version can provide additional benefits for teams working on large-scale projects or requiring enterprise-level support.

In terms of automation strategies, a combination of unit, integration, and end-to-end testing would be ideal for MindMeister. Unit tests can validate individual components such as user interface elements and data processing functions. Integration tests ensure smooth interactions between different modules of the application, including collaborative features like real-time editing and sharing. End-to-end tests cover user workflows spanning multiple components, ensuring the overall functionality and user experience of MindMeister.

Additionally, concepts like Shift Left Testing and the Testing Pyramid would be highly relevant for MindMeister's development and QA processes. Shift Left Testing emphasizes the early involvement of testing activities in the development lifecycle, allowing for faster feedback and defect detection. This approach aligns well with MindMeister's agile development methodology, enabling iterative improvements and quicker delivery of features to users. However due to the MindMeisters complexity and large code-base this approach might be limited in usefullness since this approach is used only on things which are being made, not have already been made, because od the large codebase it might not be cost-effective to retroactively implement this strategy unless the whole team is on board.

The Testing Pyramid concept advocates for a balanced test automation strategy, with a higher proportion of unit tests at the base, followed by integration tests, and fewer end-to-end tests at the top. This approach helps optimize test coverage and execution time while minimizing maintenance efforts.

Testing Diamond approach seems to be much more suitable, focusing on comprehensive end-to-end testing to ensure the reliability and usability of the application across different usage scenarios and user personas.
